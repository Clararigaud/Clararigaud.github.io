In November 2017, we made one week residency in Arles during the DatabitMe festival to experiment with the combination of digital creation and the Risograph printing machine.

During this residency, we produced a fanzine and I made two posters. 
For these posters, I experimented with creating human poses in blender associated with 3D glitch. I explored how the lightning and the materials could allow me to render something that would result nicely with the risograph printing technique, which works with a sequence of monochome layers.
