Screenshot_000 is the first edition of the [Screenshot project]({{site.url}}/randompixelorder) made in 2016, which featured the work of the following artists: 
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/bonsoirmichel">Bonsoir Michel </a>,
Code Cortal,
Digitoxine,
<a target="_blank" href="https://oeiloblique.tumblr.com/about">L'oeil Oblique </a>,
Laptop Salam,
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/paint3k/">Paint 3000</a>,
<a target="_blank" href="#">SuckTheFystem </a>,
Tchebichev,
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.tomcochien.fr/">Tom Cochien</a> and me.

For this first cover, I've tried to pay homage to <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bliss_(image)"> "Bliss"</a>, the well-known default wallpaper of Windows XP. 
The cover is a mise en abyme on which a glitched version of the green hill appears, using a databending technique performed on a bitmap format.

When the book is turned over, the cover reveals a screenshot of the Windows desktop as seen on my screen.
