For this fanzine, I decided to create a generative cover such as every copy of the book would be completely unique!

Using python, associated to a graphic library, I coded a script to create different "cloud" paterns based on a path research inspired by the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstras_algorithm"> Dijkstra algorithm </a>. My algortithm would write all the visited pixel until no more solution could be found, resulting in 40 different covers.
