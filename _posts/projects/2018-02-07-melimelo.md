I made a game with <a target="_blank" href="https://leon196.github.io/">Leon Denise</a> at the occasion of the Global Game Jam 2018. Melimelo is a game about untangling wires, and was designed and coded using Three.js in 24 hours.

You can play it <a href="https://leon.itch.io/melimelo" target="_blank">here</a>.
