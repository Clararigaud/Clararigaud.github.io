LifeZones is the book made with <a href="https://www.athanor-collectif.com/
" target="_blank">Athanor</a> as part of the [LZS-254 exhibition]({{site.url}}/lzs-254) . 

We each used our own practices to create different planets, environments, mineral and organic objects. Which would trace the different things collected from our journey in the explorer ship. 

For my part, I chose to generate planets using a hand-coded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_(graphics)" target="_blank">raytracing algorithm</a>, and I created various topographical maps using a revised version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond-square_algorithm" target="_blank">diamond square algorithm</a>.
