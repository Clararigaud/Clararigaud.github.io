LZS-254 is an exhibition made in collaboration with the <a href="https://www.athanor-collectif.com/" target="_blank" >Athanor</a> collective as part of Zinefest in 2018.

"Somewhere between scientific precision and the utopian illusions of extra-solar landscapes, the L Z S - 2 5 4 research team is deciphering the data and signals of the distant future to extract the fantasies of our cosmic fascinations. Like Hubble's images, which remain extravagant interpretations of wavelengths that our eyes cannot see, this mission report attempts to give shape to the uncertainties of astronomy without denigrating the charm of its imagery."

For this exhibition, I was responsible for the sound and design of the interactive cockpit. I designed and assembled it using raspeberry PI, arduino and Python. People could interact with the spaceship's cockpit, dynamically changing the entire soundscape and exploring the map of the last planet we'd visited.
