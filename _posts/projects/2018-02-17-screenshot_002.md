For the cover, I decided to work with 3D in blender to create a fleet of jellyfish made up of catodic screens from which the images escape. The cover was screenprinted in a black 220g mat paper 

We organised an evening at Nogozon, in Paris, to celebrate the release of the book and to give the various participants and the public an opportunity to meet together around concerts and VJing performances.
