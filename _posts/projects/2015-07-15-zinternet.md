The <a href="http://zinefest.fr/zinternet/" target="_blank">Zinternet project</a> is an interactive drawing experience that I imagined as part of the development of the <a href="http://zinefest.fr/" target="_blank">Zinefest website</a> in 2015.

For my studies, I had to make a website, and I don't like things that serve no purpose other than to get a grade. So, I suggested to <a href="http://www.disparate.fr/" target="_blank">Disparate</a>, which organises this micro-publishing festival, that I build the festivals website site for free. 

The idea behind Zinternet is a blank page on which all visitors on the site can draw. The drawings produced by visitors to the site are also posted on the <a href="https://zinternet.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">project's Tumblr</a>. These drawings are then published in the form of a fanzine available at free price in support of the Zinefest festival.

Today, it continues to accompany the Zinefest festival year after year, hosting drawings for each new edition.
