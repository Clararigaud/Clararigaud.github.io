During my secondary school years, I was interested in making  music with my friends. School wasn't really my priority and so, after failing my first year a first time, trying again and still not being good enough to go on to a "normal" second year, it was kindly suggested that I go to another school. The technical college. 

It was something completely different, everything was concrete, every theoretical subject was immediately put into practice. I loved it. Well, no, I didn't love it, but because it made sense to me, my grades improved and I gained the confidence to continue learning things at school. It was there that I discovered the magic of computing through the industrial robots that we had to programme, using <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grafcet" target ="_blank">Grafcet</a> at the time. A sort of big <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino" target ="_blank">Arduino</a>! 

This diploma doesn't open all the doors to higher education, but I wanted to learn how the internet worked. So I learnt how to make a website. To do that, I made the website for my music school's association, and I applied for the <a href="https://www.mmibordeaux.com/" target ="_blank">DUT MMI</a> in Bordeaux. I was told that I'd been accepted because I had made this website :)
