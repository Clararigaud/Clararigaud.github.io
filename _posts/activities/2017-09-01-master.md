I moved to Paris to continue my studies for a master's degree focusing on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-agent_system" target="_blank">multi-agent robotics</a>. 
During this period, I tried to specialise in topics related to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction" target="_blank">human-computer interaction</a> and 3D environmments. In parallel, I experimented a lot with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics" target="_blank">3D computer graphics</a> and video games, using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_(game_engine)" target="_blank">Unity</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blender_(software)" target="_blank">Blender</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shader" target="_blank">shaders</a>.
