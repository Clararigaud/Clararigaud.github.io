<p>At the end of my second year of master’s, I did an internship in the <a href="https://www.isir.upmc.fr/equipes/interactions/" target="_blank">Interaction Team of the ISIR laboratory</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://hci.isir.upmc.fr/gilles-bailly/" target="_blank">Gilles Bailly</a>. 
I was working on the <a href="https://hal.science/hal-02931830/document" target="_blank">COVR project</a>, which consists of a large virtual reality arena made up of a 2-axis robotic column designed to provide <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haptic_technology" target="_blank">haptic feedback</a> in Virtual Reality.</p>

<p>During this placement, I worked on the following points:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Creating virtual scenes with Unity</li>
  <li>Building a calibration tool inside Unity to align the coordinates of the VR headset with the coordinates of the motorised column</li>
  <li>Rendering the user’s real hand in the virtual environment with RGBD-based hand recognition (OpenCV).</li>
</ul>

<p>That was at this moment that I realised that HCI would be my thing.</p>
