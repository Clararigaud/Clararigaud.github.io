<p>At the end of the first year of my Master’s degree, I did a placement at the <a href="https://www.lip6.fr/" target="_blank">Lip6 laboratory</a> under the supervision of <a href="http://www-desir.lip6.fr/~herpsonc/en/" target="_blank">Cédric Herpson</a>. The goal was to perform <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot_navigation" target="_blank">robotic navigation</a> based solely on visual information and known environment artifacts. 
To do that, we conceived an algorithm capable of constructing a 3D representation of the walls of the environment in real time, during exploration of a room by the robot.
The approach was to use <a href="https://opencv.org/" target="_blank">OpenCV</a> to detect <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_(computer_vision)" target="_blank">key features</a>  in the acquired image stream, combined with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_detection" target="_blank">object detection</a> as a means of acquiring information about the distances of the walls in the room.
I didn’t regret not seeing the see that summer!</p>
