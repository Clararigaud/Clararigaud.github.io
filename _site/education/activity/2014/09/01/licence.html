<p>During my bachelor, I got hard on maths. I hadn’t done maths for ages and it was really difficult, but after a first year of struggling with the basics, I got the hang of it! 
I also discovered a whole new world: the human brain. I was introduced to psychology, cognitive science and neuroscience, and I found it fascinating!
This degree was also focused on computer science, with a bit of AI too. I became a boss with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)" target="_blank">Python</a>.
It was also during the summer of my second year that one of my computer science teachers offered me a placement at <a href="https://www.inria.fr/en/inria-centre-university-bordeaux" target="_blank">INRIA Bordeaux</a>.
I was going to get to know the inside of a research laboratory…</p>
