<p>After my baccalauréat, I moved to Bordeaux to do my technology degree. 
This diploma is quite multidisciplinary and allows you to specialise in different areas of the WEB: front-end and back-end programming, but also design, video and marketing stuff.<br />
As part of this diploma, I did an internship with a web agency, during which I was in charge of all the development work for the company’s projects. 
I was pretty good at the job, but I realised that I didn’t want to spend my life making websites for random local hotels, and that I wanted to learn more about IT and how it can be applied to other areas. I also wanted to get even with maths and find out a bit more about how the human brain works. So I decided to start a bachelor’s degree in computer science, mathematics and cognitive science.</p>
