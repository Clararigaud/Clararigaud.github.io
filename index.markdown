## Welcome to my website!
{: .sec-title }

My name is Clara and I work on projects between computer sciences, interaction, design and humanities.
 
I recently defended my [PhD thesis]({{site.url}}/research) on human-computer interaction, exploring the design of tools to support knowledge sharing in the context of fabrication and the Do-It-Yourself communities. 

Over the past ten years, I have been involved in various types of [projects]({{site.url}}/projects) alongside my university studies.

I co-created the [Random Pixel Order]({{site.url}}/randompixelorder) collective in which we worked on projects at the intersection of digital art, DIY and micro-editing, exploring and promoting virtual and physical creation techniques.

Today, I continue to work on projects involving technologies, humans and non-humans. 
I am committed to giving humans the freedom to empower themselves over technology, as well as exploring how and if technology can be part of the future of our world.

I am open to any kind of projects following my ethics :)
